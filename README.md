This Model helps us to distinguish B/w the rocks and mines for a given relative dataset, We have used Logistic Regression model on given training and test datasets to make the predictive system

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either "Rock" or "Mine." The dataset used contains 208 samples, each with 60 features, representing sonar signals. The features are numerical values derived from the reflection of sonar waves. The labels "R" and "M" correspond to rocks and mines, respectively.

The project involves:

Data Exploration: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.

Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and preparing the dataset for model training.

Model Development: Implementing and training machine learning models (possibly classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).

Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
